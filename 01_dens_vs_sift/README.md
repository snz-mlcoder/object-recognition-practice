# 🔍 Dense vs SIFT Feature Detector (with Streamlit)

This Streamlit app compares two different feature detection strategies:

- Dense feature detection: fixed-grid keypoints across the image.
- SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform): intelligent keypoint detection based on local structure.

Launch the app:

streamlit run app.py
